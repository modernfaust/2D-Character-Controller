# 2D Character Controller (Modified)
Modified Version of Brackey's 2D Character Controller

Currently this controller features:

- Smooth movement
- Jumping
- Crouching
- Events for setting up animation
- 2D Physics

My additions:
- Double Jumping
- Wall Sliding
- Crouch jumping
- Ledge Grappling
- Ground Sliding
- Ramp Sliding

My aim is to create an elegant 2D character controller with seamless movement transitions, maximizing responsiveness.

To learn how to use it check out Brackey's video on: [YouTube Channel](http://youtube.com/brackeys).

The script is based on the one provided by Brackey, which is based on the one provided by Unity.
